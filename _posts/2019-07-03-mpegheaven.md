Whilst most of the UK had their attention turned North toward Laura Muir and the rest of Team GB winning medal-after-medal in Glasgow, if you had happened to look West you will have been lucky enough to witness an excting day of action between Wales & England U20s.

On March 3rd 2019, the annual U20 indoor match between England & Wales served up an exciting affair complete with close races and record-breaking performances, all of which was successfully managed from start to finish by OpenTrack's Competition Management System. 

The day began as it was to go on with the men's Shot Put providing a final round winning throw of 17.62m by England's Lewis Byng; not quite enough for a PB for Byng but enough for a meeting record distance. All results were posted <a href="https://data.opentrack.run/x/2019/GBR/waii/event/">here</a>.
